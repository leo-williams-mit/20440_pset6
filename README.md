# 20440_pset6

## Overview
At a high level, this repository contains the code and data to take the output from a limma differential expression analysis in R, and plot a volcano plot using Bokeh for our primary vs. metastatic differential expression number 1. 
## Data
This data was generated by taking the upper quantile normalized counts from the Aurora metastatic breast cancer repository, and using limma to run a differential expression analysis in R. This generated a TopTable which had the genes, fold change, p value (both adjusted and unadjusted). Using these, we made cut offs for significance and plotted the -log_10(p value) over log2(fold change) in Bokeh. In this code, we also did some intial clean up,only considering protein coding RNAs.

## Folder Structure
There are no folders

If necessary run:
!pip install numpy, bokeh, pandas
These are the only 3 packages needed for this part of the code
